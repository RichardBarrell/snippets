<p>No, it‚Äôs not the same. It‚Äôs a compromise between the two extremes.</p>
<p>You get to skip the headaches of having to manage redundant power, fibre connectivity, most of the green-ness concerns, though you still need to do due diligence to assure yourself that the people running the DC are doing all those things to a standard which is acceptable for your use case.</p>
<p>You get to keep the cost savings from buying machines up front (and amortising the capex) instead of renting them ‚Äî this is AFAIK where <em>most</em> of the <b>opex</b> savings come from going when switching from AWS to anything else. (Do price this up against <em>reserved</em> cloud VMs rather than against <em>on-demand</em> cloud VMs though, because you‚Äôre committing quite hard when you buy servers up front.</p>
<p>You will pay more for electricity, space, physical management and connectivity than the raw price of running a DC, because of course the company running the DC wants to make a profit. Note that a big DC selling colocation to a whole bunch of customers is going to be able to get way better economies of scale on some things that are really expensive, (such as the person-time required to keep multiple actually-redundant internet connections in the face of telcos merging lines without telling you,) which might offset the cost of their profit margin until your need for machines gets gargantuan.</p>
<p>You will have to manage physical machines yourself, including managing the risk that an actual physical machine has an actual physical fault and dies. This can be ‚Äúfun‚Äù; there are good and bad ways to find out what the lead time is for Dell/HP/etc to assemble and ship a new box to a colo (IME, most of a month), try to do it one of the good ways. üò∏</p>
<blockquote><p>I was always under the impression one rented out some space and got some power outlets and network connections and everything else was managed by the DC owners.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, that‚Äôs what colocation facilities offer. You‚Äôll have to manage what the machines actually <em>do</em> by yourself. Usually a KVM-over-IP switch too for maintenance tasks. The colo will also provide basic services like ‚Äústick a Ubuntu 16.04 DVD in the drive and push the ‚Äòon‚Äô button for you so you can run the installer for that via the KVM‚Äù.</p>
